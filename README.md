Space-Age-III
=============

Space Age part III is a simple space-shooter that can be played with the mouse of your computer or a usb controller (an xbox 360 one for example). It is a continuation in my series of Space Age video games that I will be uploading. Please comment about what you think. To play you must download ALL files under downloads, and put them together in a folder, then open a file named Shooter and the game should be up and running. Screen size may need to be adjusted for right fit.
